Recently I have finished our journey with Citi Mobile Challenge. It was exciting 7 weeks! 

## Idea

It all began on 10th of March when We've decided that I and group of my friends want to join the challenge.
It appeared that on this day we are not only registering ourselves but we are supposed to submit diagrams with use cases, narrative for our app and write something about our team and create website. After few hours and dozens of emails exchanged we decided about one specific idea:

> I'm your Bank in your smart device. You can simply talk to me.

## Analysis

After 3 days of waiting we've finally received confirmation that we can start next round with deadline of 29th March.
For 2nd round we had to prepare movie about our idea, do user UX/CX analysis which results with customer journey mapping, a lot of descriptions regarding elevator pitch, target audience, sdks, api etc. At this time we have exchanged more than hundred of emails. Mailbox app wasn't stable when reading and writing to this conversation so we moved to Slack and Trello.
UX/CX

Never heard about Customer Experience methodologies like Customer Journey mapping? Read it here and then try it: smaply.com. It's great fun, especially from engineer role perspective, even if we were not doing it 100% properly.

## Communication

Moving to Trello's kanban simplifies task organization. Moving communication to Slack makes communication fast and easy. Slack enables integration from many other apps - I've configured Trello and GitHub for this project. Slack has nice native app and it works great on mobile. Trello and Slack are great only when everyone starts using them and luckily all of us enjoyed using both products.

## Development

Preparing demo was invaluable experience in terms of multi-platform development and rapid prototyping. Some of core frameworks we have been able to use: Speech2Text, Text2Speech, Google Wear SDK, IBM Bluemix, IBM Watson. Having all kind of devices (different android devices, google wear) was crucial. Showing emulator is not great idea.

## Demo Day

It was very long and tiring day - if I could change one thing, I would go sleep earlier day before to have more energy. I've met a lot of people from around the world that are open to new ideas. Movie and slide deck got attention and prototype received huge applause when finally responded properly to commands.

We haven't win but overall I think we did great job and had a lot of fun.
